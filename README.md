# open-optimization-data-structures-and-algorithms

Textbook on Data Structures and Algorithms used for a course at the Computer Science Department of Ecole Polytechnique (France). 

The course was offered to 2nd year students, during the fall terms of the academic years 2011/12 and 2012/13. What with Ecole Polytechnique being a "Grande Ã‰cole" who accepts students who studied two years at a "preparatory school" (essentially an intensive 2-year B.Sc. course given at a school midway between a high school and a teaching university), these students took the course when they were 21-22 years old. 

I am not a specialist in data structures and algorithms (and it shows). My motivation for writing the book was that Polytechnique students are used to having "the book for the course" written by the teacher. I initially told them that there were much better books for data structures and algorithms than I could ever write, but my arguments were ignored: I was to write a book. When this was done, I was silently reproached because the book was not written in French. I therefore inserted some parts about applications of algorithms to linguistics, with some sentences in French --- this was as far as I was willing to compromise :-)

The approach I took was to inherit a syllabus from previous years, make it evolve slightly towards topics I was more familiar with (combinatorial optimization), and explain anything I didn't know (which was more or less everything) to myself down to the minute details, so that I wouldn't make any blatant blunder in class. I hope my approach was successful. My students did reasonably well in their exams, so I guess that's a reasonably good sign.
